# Data Contracts

This document records the data contracts for GeoSpoiler enriched v2 pipeline.
All cards use `enriched_v2` schema. No backward compatibility with v1.

## Modules

- `models.py` — Pydantic models: `LLMPayload`, `EnrichedCardV2`, `NormalizedMeta`
- `data_validation.py` — validators and Markdown report generation
- `enricher/validator.py` — runtime contract checks on LLM output
- `enricher/preprocessor.py` — text cleaning before LLM
- `enricher/repair.py` — single repair pass for contract violations

## Pipeline Architecture

```
normalized text + .meta.json
  -> content_type classifier (rule-based)
  -> triage (keep or reviewer queue)
  -> preprocessor (header, clean_text, ignored_blocks)
  -> LLM extraction (returns LLMPayload only)
  -> structural schema validation
  -> validator (semantic contract checks)
  -> repair (optional, max 1 LLM call total per card)
  -> postprocessor (assembles EnrichedCardV2)
  -> graph_text / search_text builders (code-built)
  -> enriched_v2 card written to disk
```

## Responsibility Split

### LLM returns (LLMPayload):
- summary, key_points, entities, topics, theses, quotes, events, search_phrases, quality_flags

### Code builds:
- schema_version, prompt_version, enrichment_model, enriched_at
- provenance, content_type, language
- source_chain, ignored_blocks
- graph_text, search_text

## EnrichedCardV2 Fields

- `schema_version` — always `"enriched_v2"`
- `prompt_version` — version of the extraction instructions, e.g. `"enriched_prompt_v2"`
- `enrichment_model` — model used for extraction
- `enriched_at` — ISO timestamp
- `provenance` — `{source_id, source_type, channel, date, post_url, message_id, forwarded_from, normalized_path}`
- `content_type` — one of: `telegram_post`, `telegram_forward`, `youtube_transcript`, `instagram_text`, `web_article_text`, `mixed_normalized_text`, `unknown`
- `language` — default `"ru"`
- `summary` — 1-3 sentences in Russian, source-attributed
- `key_points` — list of `{text, type, importance, evidence}`
- `entities` — dict of categories, each a list of `{text, role, salience}`
- `topics` — list of `{label, salience, type}`
- `theses` — list of `{text, speaker, stance, evidence}`
- `quotes` — list of `{text, speaker, context}`
- `events` — list of `{event_type, description, date_text, date_normalized, location, actors}`
- `search_phrases` — list of `{text, source}`
- `source_chain` — `{original_source, forwarded_from, mentioned_sources, external_links}`
- `graph_text` — code-built compact relational text for LightRAG
- `search_text` — code-built dense flat text for FTS/BM25
- `ignored_blocks` — preprocessor-detected media placeholders `{type, text}`
- `quality_flags` — data quality signals (list of strings)
- `extraction_issues` — validator diagnostics retained when a repair could not
  remove a contract violation; excluded from graph and search text

## Removed from v2 (no longer exist)

- `key_facts` / `claim_type`
- `query_aliases`
- `triage` / `triage_reason`
- `visual` / `broll`
- `noise`
- `dedup`
- `version` (int)
- `chunks` (long inputs are chunked and merged internally, but chunks are not persisted)

Long-text chunk extraction carries every LLM-owned semantic field through the
internal merge. `ignored_blocks` never comes from chunk LLM output: the
preprocessor detects it once for the complete document and the postprocessor
copies it to the final card.

## Key Point Types

Allowed `key_points[].type`:

- `reported_statement`
- `reported_event`
- `opinion`
- `prediction`
- `accusation`
- `quote_summary`
- `source_reference`
- `announcement`
- `numeric_claim`
- `other`

## Content Types (rule-based, code determines)

- `telegram_post`
- `telegram_forward`
- `youtube_transcript`
- `instagram_text`
- `web_article_text`
- `mixed_normalized_text`
- `unknown`

## Entity Structure

```json
{"text": "NATO", "role": "organization", "salience": "primary"}
```

Categories: people, organizations, countries, locations, military_units, equipment, weapons, programs_projects, media_sources, other.

No `evidence` field in entities for MVP.

## Strict Enumerations

- `key_points[].importance`: `high`, `medium`, `low`
- `entities.*[].salience` and `topics[].salience`: `primary`, `secondary`, `mentioned`
- `topics[].type`: `case_topic`, `policy_topic`, `military_topic`, `diplomatic_topic`, `economic_topic`, `rhetoric_topic`, `source_topic`, `regional_topic`, `technology_topic`, `sanctions_topic`, `energy_topic`, `migration_topic`, `other`
- `theses[].stance`: `supportive`, `critical`, `accusatory`, `alarmist`, `sarcastic`, `neutral_explanatory`, `interpretive`, `predictive`, `mobilizing`, `unclear`
- `events[].event_type`: `reported_statement`, `meeting`, `agreement`, `attack`, `strike`, `military_movement`, `exercise`, `launch`, `decision`, `vote`, `publication`, `announcement`, `negotiation`, `sanction`, `accusation`, `arrest`, `border_incident`, `economic_measure`, `unknown`
- `search_phrases[].source`: `surface_form`, `phrase_from_text`, `constructed_from_present_terms`
- `ignored_blocks[].type`: `image`, `video`, `audio`, `instagram`, `ai_chat`, `media_omitted`, `unknown`
- `quality_flags`: `mostly_boilerplate`, `very_short_text`, `contains_legacy_media_placeholders`, `no_substantive_content`, `unclear_source_chain`, `mixed_topics`, `possible_duplicate`, `extraction_unstable`

Unknown fields and values are schema errors. Raw LLM output is validated against
`LLMPayload` before it is accepted; legacy `query_aliases` is rejected.

## Extraction Failure Policy

- A substantive input must not turn an empty LLM response into an empty card.
- Empty, non-object, or schema-invalid raw JSON is a structural extraction failure.
- Structural failure may use the job's single repair LLM call. If that repair is
  empty or still schema-invalid, the job fails explicitly. No card is written and
  enrichment progress is not updated; the batch continues with the next job.
- Structural and semantic repair share one budget: at most one repair LLM call per job.
- If a structurally valid payload violates semantic contract rules, an unsuccessful
  repair may be persisted with `extraction_unstable` only when `summary` or
  `key_points` still contains usable extracted content.
- A substantive semantic payload with neither `summary` nor `key_points` is an
  unusable extraction and fails without writing output or progress.

## Language Policy

- summary, key_points, topics, theses, events, graph_text — Russian
- entities.text — original surface form (NATO, DPRK, Xi Jinping)
- quotes.text — original language (verbatim)
- search_text — mixed (Russian + original terms)
- search_phrases — mixed

## Wiki Contract Status

The active Wiki contract is SQLite schema v6,
`geospoiler-wiki-sqlite-v6-effective-relations-review-fts-analysis-cache`.
Existing databases with another version/contract are rejected; there is no
silent migration or reset.

The contract is retained for future use, but the subsystem is dormant by
default. `WIKI_ENABLED=false` prevents configured ingest, review, projection,
CLI, and retrieval paths from opening or mutating Wiki state.

Source-of-truth classes:

- Enriched v2 and YouTube segment revisions;
- approved concepts and identity aliases;
- concept/hierarchy review history, including rejects and reopens;
- pinned claim-specific ambiguity and grouping/link overrides;
- manual sidecar Markdown.

Rebuildable classes:

- immutable extraction artifacts and effective occurrence lifecycle;
- registry candidates and surface snapshots;
- cached Luna identity/hierarchy analyses keyed by their exact inputs;
- exact claim groups and automatic concept links;
- computed card relations;
- card, claim, and hub projections;
- generated Markdown and Wiki FTS documents.

Identity invariants:

- one lineage comes from native `provenance.source_id` or `segment_id`, never
  from a file path/array index;
- `occurrence_version_id` uses lineage, field kind, stable locator, exact
  payload hash, and occurrence schema version; a card-wide hash is provenance,
  not occurrence identity;
- current state is selected by committed run sequence/generation, never by
  timestamp;
- exact locator continuity may produce `superseded`; otherwise changed text is
  `retired` plus a new active occurrence;
- claim occurrences are never physically merged;
- authoritative overrides overlay automatic results and become `stale` rather
  than disappearing when their fingerprint no longer matches.

Registry/hub invariants:

- proposals are not concepts;
- a surface needs two independent substantive clusters; reposts do not satisfy
  that threshold;
- identity aliases are `canonical`, `technical`, `abbreviation`,
  `translation`, or `spelling`; contextual metonyms are forbidden aliases;
- relation roles are `subject | actor | object | context | mentioned |
  unknown`, with `unknown` safely aggregating as context;
- one card may relate to multiple approved concepts;
- one primary hierarchy parent is allowed; related concepts are bounded;
- Markdown hubs contain references to Enriched cards, not copied card state;
- `manual_sidecars` are authoritative, while `projection_artifacts`,
  `output/wiki/`, and `wiki_fts_documents` are disposable.

The complete table, CAS, extraction, and projection contract is documented in
`docs/wiki_v2_sqlite_contract.md`.

## Validator Rules

Contract checks (not truth):
- No `canonical_id`
- No aliases absent from text
- Quotes present in source text
- Topics not overly generic
- Entities not from ignored blocks
- No forbidden quality_flags (fake_news, propaganda, false_claim)
- Payload not empty when text is substantive
- `no_substantive_content` is removed when the final payload contains content
- `extraction_unstable` is assigned by the pipeline only after validation/repair
  failure; the remaining validator violations are stored in `extraction_issues`

## Provenance

Stable source ids derived in order:
1. Existing `source_id`
2. `telegram:{channel_id}:{message_id}`
3. `telegram:{channel}:{message_id}`

Every persisted v2 card must contain a non-empty `provenance.source_id`.
Progress invalidation includes the SHA-256 fingerprint of both normalized text and
metadata, schema version, prompt version, and enrichment model. A metadata-only
change therefore cannot leave an old enriched card marked up to date.

## YouTube Long-Form Checkpoints

- Long YouTube sources are segmented when they cross the deterministic character
  or duration threshold in `enricher/youtube_segmenter.py`.
- Each successfully extracted segment is written to an isolated checkpoint under
  `state/youtube_checkpoints/<source-digest>/<fingerprint>/` before the next
  segment is requested.
- The checkpoint manifest records the checkpoint fingerprint, active
  `enrichment_model`, expected segment count, file names, and SHA-256 hashes. A
  `youtube_segment_v2` card also records `enrichment_model`.
- The source fingerprint controls whether a completed episode card is current.
  The separate checkpoint fingerprint additionally includes the active model.
  Therefore changing profile can leave a completed card untouched while never
  reusing an in-progress segment from another model.
- A changed transcript, metadata, model, prompt, schema, or segmentation version
  creates a different checkpoint fingerprint and cannot reuse the old checkpoint.
- Checkpoints are removed only after the episode card, manifest, and child
  segments are successfully published. An interrupted run can therefore resume
  completed segments without publishing a half-written final generation.
- Final-generation cleanup of old backups and legacy outputs is best-effort and
  happens after the new generation is committed; cleanup failure must not roll
  back a valid new generation.

## Validation Command

```powershell
python main.py validate enriched
```

Scans `output/enriched`, writes Markdown report under `artifacts/`.
